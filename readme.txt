TODO list:

idol editions, perks
description of all game actions in every game file
potentially more bugs with izone members

possible additions:

group rerolling for opponent after they outbid for an idol
searching up idol stats without having to type in group
searching up stats without any names automatically pulls stats for idol of current turn
removing certain inputs if money/roster space is insufficient
