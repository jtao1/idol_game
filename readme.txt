TODO list:

perks
booster packs?

--

Groups to add: Rocket Punch, QWER
Potential: cignature, X:IN, weeekly

Once main feature todo list completed, finalize list of groups to add,
then reset idol stats and create these new stats:

+general winrate
+ultimate bias pickrate
+opponent reroll rate
+letter synergy rate
+deluxe reroll pickrate?
distribution of successful letter synergies

Have a description of all game actions in every game file
OR 
Remove game history files entirely, only track idol stats
Possibly database/online file storage for idol stats/game history?
