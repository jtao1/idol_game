Groups to add:
Rocket Punch
QWER
Potential: cignature, X:IN

TODO list:

"help" command (essentially a command list)

idol variants
perks
upgrade minigame (endgame feature, can be bought for $2 after all DR's finished)

--

Once main feature todo list completed, think of all groups to add, 
then reset idol stats and create these new stats:

+opponent reroll rate
+idol winrate
+letter synergy rate
+ultimate bias pickrate

Have a description of all game actions in every game file
Possibly database/online file storage for idol stats/game history?
