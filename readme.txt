TODO list:

should upgrade minigame give a new idol on successful upgrade or simply upgrade current idol's rating?

"help" command (essentially a command list)
give players a choice on whether they want to steal a duplicate idol or not?
add option to cancel for deluxe rerolls, letter synergy replacements, group synergy switches

perks
booster packs?

--

Groups to add: Rocket Punch, QWER
Potential: cignature, X:IN, weeekly

Once main feature todo list completed, finalize list of groups to add,
then reset idol stats and create these new stats:

+general winrate
+ultimate bias pickrate
+opponent reroll rate
+letter synergy rate
+deluxe reroll pickrate?
when letter synergy is hit, which letter is it?

Have a description of all game actions in every game file
OR 
Remove game history files entirely, only track idol stats
Possibly database/online file storage for idol stats/game history?
